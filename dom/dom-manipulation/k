Simple To-Do List:

Create an input box and a button.
When the button is clicked, retrieve the input value, create a new list item (<li>), and append it to an unordered list (<ul>).
Interactive Calculator:

Design a calculator interface using HTML buttons for digits and operations.
Use JavaScript to handle button clicks, perform calculations, and display results dynamically.
Color Flipper:

Create an array of colors.
Change the background color of a webpage randomly when a button is clicked.
Image Carousel:

Display a set of images in a carousel format (next and previous buttons).
Use JavaScript to handle the logic of switching between images.
Interactive Quiz:

Create a series of questions and multiple-choice answers.
Calculate and display the score based on user selections.
Accordion:

Implement a simple accordion interface where clicking on a section expands or collapses its content.
Form Validation:

Build a form with input fields (e.g., name, email, password).
Validate the form inputs using JavaScript to ensure they meet certain criteria (e.g., required fields, correct email format).
Weather App:

Use a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch current weather data based on user input (e.g., city name).
Display the weather information dynamically on the webpage.
Countdown Timer:

Create a countdown timer that counts down from a specified time (e.g., 10 minutes).
Display the remaining time and update it dynamically until it reaches zero.
Drag and Drop Interface:

Implement a simple drag-and-drop functionality where elements can be dragged and dropped into designated areas.
