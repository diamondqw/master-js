Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard:

Description: Build a web application where multiple users can draw simultaneously on a shared canvas in real-time. Use WebSocket technology for synchronization and ensure smooth interaction among users.

Features:

Canvas Drawing: Implement drawing tools (e.g., pen, eraser, color picker) on an HTML5 canvas element.
Real-Time Sync: Use WebSocket (e.g., Socket.io) to synchronize drawing actions across all connected clients in real-time.
User Authentication: Allow users to sign in with a username or anonymously. Display users' cursors and drawings in different colors or styles.
Chat Interface: Include a chat feature where users can communicate while drawing.
Undo/Redo: Implement undo and redo functionality for drawing actions.
Save/Load: Allow users to save their drawings and load them later. Use local storage or a backend server for saving drawings.
Technologies:

HTML5 Canvas for drawing capabilities.
JavaScript for client-side logic, WebSocket communication, and DOM manipulation.
WebSocket technology (e.g., Socket.io) for real-time communication.
Optional: Node.js or another backend technology for server-side WebSocket handling and data persistence.
Skills Involved:

Advanced DOM manipulation for handling canvas interactions and WebSocket events.
Handling complex data synchronization and real-time updates between multiple clients.
User interface design and user experience considerations for a collaborative application.
Optionally, backend development skills for managing user sessions, saving data, and handling WebSocket connections on the server side.
This project will challenge your skills in both front-end and potentially back-end development, focusing on real-time collaboration and interactive drawing features. It's a great opportunity to delve into WebSocket technology and build a dynamic and engaging application.
