Event Handling and DOM Manipulation:

Question: Explain the difference between addEventListener and onclick for attaching event handlers to DOM elements. When would you prefer to use one over the other in a frontend application?

Answer Guidance: This question tests understanding of modern event handling practices (addEventListener) versus the older onclick attribute method. Candidates should demonstrate awareness of advantages like multiple event handlers and separation of concerns.

Dynamic Content Creation:

Question: Describe how you would dynamically create a list of items using JavaScript and append it to an existing <ul> element in the DOM. Include considerations for performance and accessibility.

Answer Guidance: This assesses practical knowledge of DOM manipulation techniques. Candidates should mention creating elements with document.createElement, setting attributes and content, and appending them to the DOM efficiently.

Form Validation and Interaction:

Question: Explain how you would implement client-side form validation using JavaScript. What are the key aspects to consider for ensuring a user-friendly experience?

Answer Guidance: This tests understanding of form validation techniques, including event handling (submit event), validating input values, providing feedback (e.g., error messages), and preventing form submission on errors.

Handling Asynchronous Events:

Question: Discuss how you would manage asynchronous data loading and DOM manipulation in a frontend application. What are some best practices for ensuring smooth user interaction?

Answer Guidance: Candidates should demonstrate familiarity with asynchronous programming concepts (e.g., fetch API, Promises, async/await), updating the DOM dynamically based on data retrieval, and handling loading states gracefully.

Cross-browser Compatibility:

Question: How do you ensure cross-browser compatibility when developing JavaScript-based features for a website? Provide examples of challenges and solutions you've encountered.

Answer Guidance: This question assesses knowledge of browser inconsistencies and techniques for handling them (e.g., feature detection, polyfills, vendor prefixing). Candidates should mention testing and debugging across different browsers.
