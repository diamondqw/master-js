Certainly! Here are some more challenging coding questions related to the DOM and JavaScript:

Dynamic Content Creation:

Write a function that dynamically creates a table with a given number of rows and columns, where each cell contains its row and column indices. Append this table to a specified container in the DOM.
Event Delegation and Efficiency:

Implement event delegation to handle click events on a list of <li> elements. When clicked, toggle a class on the clicked <li> and ensure that clicking any <li> does not attach an individual event listener directly to each element.
Complex DOM Manipulation:

Create a form with multiple input fields (text, checkbox, select). Upon form submission, gather all entered data and dynamically generate a summary section in another part of the document displaying this data in a structured format.
Interactive Elements and State Management:

Build a multi-step wizard-like interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each step should have its content and controls (like 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons) that dynamically load and unload content without refreshing the page.
Performance Optimization:

Implement a mechanism to efficiently render a large dataset (e.g., 1000 items) as a list in the DOM. Ensure that only the visible items are rendered initially, and as the user scrolls, dynamically load and unload items to maintain smooth performance.
Responsive Design and DOM Manipulation:

Develop a responsive navigation menu that changes its layout (e.g., from horizontal to vertical) based on the viewport size. Ensure smooth transitions and usability enhancements like touch support on mobile devices.
Advanced Animation and Interaction:

Create an interactive image gallery where clicking on thumbnails updates a larger display area with the selected image. Implement smooth transitions between images using CSS animations or JavaScript effects.
