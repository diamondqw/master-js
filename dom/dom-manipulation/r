Got it! Let's aim for something engaging and moderately challenging, but not excessively complex. Here's a project idea that should fit that description:

Interactive Recipe Search and Display:

Description: Create a web application where users can search for recipes based on ingredients or dish names. Display recipe details including ingredients, instructions, and images fetched from a recipe API.

Features:

Search Bar: Implement a search bar where users can enter ingredients or dish names.
API Integration: Use a recipe API (such as Edamam or TheMealDB) to fetch recipe data based on user queries.
Display Results: Show search results in a grid or list format with recipe names and images.
Details Modal: When a user clicks on a recipe, display detailed information including ingredients and instructions in a modal or separate view.
Favorites: Allow users to add recipes to a favorites list stored in local storage.
Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
Technologies:

HTML, CSS for structure and styling.
JavaScript for DOM manipulation and API integration.
Use of localStorage or sessionStorage for storing favorites.
Optional: Bootstrap or another CSS framework for responsive design.
Skills Involved:

Handling asynchronous operations with APIs.
DOM manipulation to dynamically display data.
Managing state (e.g., favorites list) using local storage.
Creating a user-friendly interface with search and interactive modal views.
